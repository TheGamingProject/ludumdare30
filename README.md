The planets swirl over head and you can feel their power flow through you. Unleash your devastating Kung-Fu on those who would oppose you! 

Planet Kung-Fu is a beat 'em up action game heavily inspired by your favorite Kung-Fu film (Enter the Dragon). In Planet Kung-Fu the character finds himself imbued by the planets alignment above him. As your move through the map the planets will orbit above you changing your power as you go along. Fighting through hordes of enemies you must prove yourself to the planets with a body count worthy of your power. 

Press Z to preform your Kung-Fu moves 
Press X to invoke the your planetary power. 
This game was made by The Gaming Project, this is our fifth time doing a Ludum Dare Game Jam and it is always fun. We hope that you enjoy our latest creation "Planet Kung-Fu" as much as we do.
